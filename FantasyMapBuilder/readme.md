this was orignally made to replace coral draw in my perosnal use, I had gotten a new computer and i was using corel draw for fantasy maps creation.

since the new computer did not support the old version of coral draw I was using, and my parents didn't want to buy a new one for me at the time, I had tried to recreate what coral draw had done, I had some success in my personal project, however it had issues due to using java2d and probably less than nessassary understanding of how graphics work at that time.
